## 📈 Projects & Works

Here are some of the core projects I’ve built:

## 🔍 Interests & Research

- ⚖️ I’m deeply interested in **economics, finance, and systemic measurements**  
- I’m working on a new model to **rethink how countries’ wealth / progress is quantified** — an alternative to GDP, factoring in technology, knowledge, sustainability, and human capital  
- I often write essays or short papers on these topics and intend to publish my framework in time  

---

## 🎧 Extracurricular & Personal Touches

- I’ve also experimented with **Vue.js lately** — you’ll see pushes in those repos  
- (Optional) **Spotify / listening stats** — you can integrate with e.g. `spotify-readme` tools to show your top tracks / artists  
- I blend **technical product building** with **financial & economic thinking** — I want my output to not just be functional, but meaningful at macro scale
